### Git Branching and Merging - Detailed Tutorial

#### Introduction

- Objective: Learn branching, merging, and feature branch workflow.
- Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Git and GitHub.

#### Branching in Git

- **Concept**: Branching allows you to work on different parts of a project without interfering with the main codebase.
- **Scenario**: Working on a feature with incomplete commits, a bug fix is needed.
- **Solution**: Create a new branch to fix the bug, keeping it separate from the ongoing feature work.

**Steps to Create Branch:**

```sh
git branch feature1       # Create a new branch named 'feature1'
git checkout feature1     # Switch to the new branch
```

- **Visualizing Branches**:

```sh
git log --all --graph     # View all branches and commits
```

#### Merging in Git

- **Purpose**: Combine changes from different branches into a single branch.
- **Concept**: Takes changes from one branch and combines them with another.

**Sample Merge Command:**

```sh
git checkout master        # Switch to master branch
git merge feature1         # Merge 'feature1' into 'master'
git commit -m "Merge feature1"   # Commit the merge
```

- **Example Visual Check**:

```sh
git log --all --graph
```

#### Handling Merge Conflicts

- **Issue**: When the same file/line is changed in both branches.
- **Solution**: Manually resolve the conflict by choosing the correct lines of code.

**Steps:**

```sh
git checkout master
git merge conflictBranch   # Attempt to merge, notice conflict
# Resolve the conflicts in the code manually by choosing the correct lines
git add .                  # Add resolved conflicts
git commit -m "Resolved conflicts" # Commit the resolution
```

#### Feature Branch Workflow

- **Concept**: Workflow that involves creating a new branch per feature, uploading to GitHub, code reviews, and then merging into master.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Create Feature Branch**:
     ```sh
     git branch newFeature
     git checkout newFeature
     ```
  2. **Make Changes and Commit**:
     ```sh
     # Make changes in code
     git add .
     git commit -m "New feature added"
     ```
  3. **Push to GitHub**:
     ```sh
     git push origin newFeature
     ```
  4. **Create Pull Request on GitHub**:
     - Go to Pull Requests tab in the repository.
     - Compare `newFeature` with `master`.
     - Create Pull Request and write a description.

#### Resolving Pull Request Conflicts

- If conflict arises from another pull request, resolve locally.

**Steps to Resolve Locally**:

1. **Update Local Master**:
   ```sh
   git checkout master
   git pull origin master
   ```
2. **Switch to Feature Branch and Merge Master**:
   ```sh
   git checkout featureBranch
   git merge master
   ```
3. **Resolve Conflicts**:
   ```sh
   # Fix conflicts in code manually
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```
4. **Push the Resolved Branch**:
   ```sh
   git push origin featureBranch
   ```

- **Final Steps**:
  - Confirm merge on GitHub.
  - Sync local repository using `git fetch` and `git pull`.

```sh
git fetch origin
git pull origin master
```
